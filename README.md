Formalization of Hindley-Milner type inference in Agda. 

The most recent Agda version (2.6.2.1) (git hash 283b3d5adb4d07288c817d71f25e91b3449287ae)
has been used to typecheck the formalization.

The main results are available in the following modules (and corresponding file paths):

 - Main induction for unification algorithm: `Verification.Core.Theory.Std.Specific.ProductTheory.Variant.Unification.Instance.PCF.Main`
 - Main induction for type inference: `Verification.Core.Data.Language.HindleyMilner.Variant.Classical.Typed.Typecheck.Main`
