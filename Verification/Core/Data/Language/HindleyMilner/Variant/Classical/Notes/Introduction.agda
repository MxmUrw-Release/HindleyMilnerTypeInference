-- | The Hindley-Milner type system is a polymorphic type system for
--   lambda-calculus terms which allows for complete type inference.
--   It was, alongside the inference algorithm, independently
--   discovered by Hindley \cite{TT:Hindley:1969} and Milner \cite{TT:Milner:1978}.
--   A further detailed description was done by Damas \cite{TT:Damas:1984}.
