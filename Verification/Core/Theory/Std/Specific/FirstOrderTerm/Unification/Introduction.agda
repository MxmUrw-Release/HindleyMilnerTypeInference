--   (elements of term powersets) are unified.
-- | \citet{UnifyCat:SchmidtSiekmann:1988} modify the approach to re-include
--    variables in order to attain an algorithm without unnecessary renaming steps.
--    But this requires their theory to move away from the conventional categorical
--    framework given in \cite{UnifyCat:RydeheardBurstall:1986}.
