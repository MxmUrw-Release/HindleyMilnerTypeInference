-- = Overview

-- | Computer science is, compared to mathematics, a very young field of research.
--   And it is a unique property, that the theory is very near to its applications
--   (complexity theory can inform real algorithm construction, compiler design should
--    deal with real-world compiler design problems, \dots).
--   But they are not, in fact, merged. Writing a theoretical paper does not produce an
--   algorithm which can be run.

-- | Considering the advent of proof assistants such as Agda, Coq, Idris, Lean, \dots,
--   it seems unfortunate, since such a thing should theoretically be possible.
--   The obstacles are of ergonomic nature: Developing inside of proof assistants
--   requires a much higher level of detail than a pen-and-paper explanation. And
--   thus it should be clear that one cannot and should not expect formalizations
--   to completely replace all publications.
--   But even if one wishes to drop down to the technical level of formalizations,
--   to reap the benefit of executability, the currently available tools are not
--   entirely satisfactory.
